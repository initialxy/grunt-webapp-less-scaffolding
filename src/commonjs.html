        Building CommonJS modules with Browserify is very straightforward. It
        looks just like js build type, but Browserify will be used to wrap them.
        Please note that CommonJS modules cannot be imported into browser in
        their raw forms. So you are expected to build it first and run it from
        dist directory.

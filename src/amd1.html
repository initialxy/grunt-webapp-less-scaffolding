        <!--
        To build AMD, you just need to wrap your main file with a special amd
        build type. However keep in mind that there should be at most two files
        in the build:amd block. If one file is given, the same file will be used
        for both mainConfigFile and name properties. If two files are given, the
        first file will be used for mainConfigFile and second file will be used
        for name property. Any excessive files will be ignored. Note that this
        build is smart enough to parse baseUrl out of config file to be used for
        RequireJS Optimizer build. If baseUrl is not defined in config file,
        path to main file will be used as baseUrl. Please see amd2.html to see
        an alternative setup.
